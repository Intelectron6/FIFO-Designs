# FIFO-Designs
Verilog codes of Synchronous and Asynchronous FIFOs. </br>

Synchronous FIFO :  </br>
  Depth = 8 (hence Address width = 3 bits)  </br>
  Data width = 16 bits  </br>
  Extra address bit to help distinguish between full and empty conditions  </br>
  
Asynchronous FIFO :  </br>
  Depth = 8 (hence Address width = 3 bits)  </br>
  Data width = 16 bits  </br>
  Gray code pointer for 2-flop synchronization  </br>
  Binary code pointer for addressing  </br>

"Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design" by Clifford E. Cummings, Sunburst Design, Inc. was referred for the designs. Going through the document is highly recommended.
